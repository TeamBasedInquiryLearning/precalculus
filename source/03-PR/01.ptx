    <p>Quadratic functions have many different applications in the real world. For example, say we want to identify a point at which the maximum profit or minimum cost occurs. Before we can interpret some of these situations, however, we will first need to understand how to read the graphs of quadratic functions to locate these least and greatest values. </p>

    <activity xml:id="activity-1">
        <introduction>
          <p>Use the graph of the quadratic function <m>f(x)=3(x-2)^2-4</m> to fill in the table shown below.</p>

        <task> <p> How would you describe the behavior of this function? What is happening to the <m>y</m>-values as the <m>x</m>-values increase? Do you notice any other patterns in the <m>y</m>-values of the table?</p>
        </task>
        <task> <p>At which point <m>(x,y)</m> does the graph reach itâ€™s maximum or minimum value? How can you tell from the graph that this is the maximum or minimum value?</p>
        </task>
        <task> <p> Look at the function given and the graph of the function. What do you notice? Is there a faster way to find the maximum or minimum value from the given function? </p>

    <definition xml:id="vertex form of a quadratic function">
      <statement>
        <p> The vertex form of a quadratic function is given by <m>f(x)=a(x-h)^2+k</m>, where <m>(h, k)</m> is the vertex of the parabola and <m>x = h</m> is the axis of symmetry.
        </p>

    <activity xml:id="activity-1">
      <introduction>
        <p> Use the given the quadratic function, <m>f(x)=3(x-2)^2-4</m>, to answer the following: </p>

      <task> <p> Apply the definition to find the vertex of the parabola and the axis of symmetry.</p>

        <p>It would be great to include videos down here, like in the Calculus book!</p>
