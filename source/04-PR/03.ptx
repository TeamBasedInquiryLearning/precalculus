      <statement>
        <p>Just like with quadratic functions, we should be able to determine key characteristics that will help guide us in creating a sketch of any polynomial function. We can start by finding both <m> x </m> and <m> y </m>-intercepts and then explore other characteristics polynomial functions can have. Recall that the <term>zeros</term> of a function are the <term><m>x</m>-intercepts </term> - i.e., the values of <m>x</m> that cross or touch the <m>x</m>-axis. Just like with quadratic functions, we can find the zeros of a function by setting the function equal to <m>0</m> and solving for <m>x</m>.</p>

      <statement>
        <p> From <xref ref="degree-and-leading-coefficient-of-polynomial-graphs"/>, we saw that the degree and leading coefficient of a polynomial function can give us more clues about the behavior of the function. In summary, we know: 
          <ul><li>If the degree is even, the ends of the polynomial function will be going in the same direction. If the leading coefficient is positive, both ends will be pointing up. If the leading coefficient is negative, both ends will be pointing down. </li>
          <li> If the degree is odd, the ends of the polynomial function will be going in opposite directions. If the leading coefficient is positive, the left end will fall and the right end will rise. If the leading coefficient is negative, the left end will rise and the right end will fall.</li></ul>

          <p> Refer back to <xref ref="intro-to-multiplicities"/> and <xref ref="PR5-finding-multiplicity-from-equation-and-graph"/>. Notice that when the graph crosses the <m> x </m>-axis at the zero, the mulitplicity of that zero is odd. When the graph touches the <m> x </m>-axis at the zero, the multiplicity is even. In other words, factors of <m> f(x)</m> with odd exponents will cross the <m> x </m>-axis and factors of <m> f(x)</m> with even exponents will touch the <m> x</m>-axis. </p>

    <p> When graphing polynomial functions, you may notice that these functions have some "hills" and "valleys."

      <p> We can estimate where these local maxima and minima occur by looking at other characteristics, such as multiplicities and end behavior.

      <p> From <xref ref="PR5-finding-max-and-min"/>, we saw that when the function touches the <m>x</m>-axis at a zero, then that zero could be either a local maximum or a local minimum of the graph. When the function crosses the <m>x</m>-axis, however, the local maximum or local minimum occurs between the zeros.
