          Linear equations can be used to solve many types of real-world applications.  We'll investigate some of those in this section.

        Distance, rate, and time problems are a standard example of an application of a linear equation. For these, it's important to remember that <me>
          d=rt
        </me> where <m>d</m> is distance, <m>r</m> is the rate (or speed), and <m>t</m> is time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Often we will have more than one moving object, so it is helpful to denote which object's distance, rate, or time we are referring to. One way we can do this is by using a subscript. For example, if we are describing an eastbound train (as we will in the first example), it may be helpful to denote its distance, rate, and time as <m>d_E</m>, <m>r_E</m>, and <m>t_E</m> respectively. Notice that the subscript <m>E</m> is a label reminding us that we are referring to the eastbound train.

              <li>The <m>400</m> miles is irrelevant. They've been traveling the same amount of time so they must be the same distance away from the station. That tells us  <m>d_E = d_W </m>. </li>
              <li>The <m>400</m> miles is the difference between the distance each train traveled, so <m>d_E - d_W = 400</m>. </li>

        <p> Jalen needs groceries, so decides to ride his bike to the store. It takes him half an hour to get there. After finishing his shopping, he sees his friend Alex who offers him a ride home. He takes the same route home as he did to the store, but this time it only takes one-fifth of an hour. If his average speed was <m>18</m> mph faster on the way home, how far away does Jalen live from the grocery store? </p>

        <p>
          We'll use the subscript <m>b</m> to refer to variables relating to Jalen's trip to the store while riding his <m>b</m>ike and the subscript <m>c</m> to refer to variables relating to Jalen's trip home while riding in his friend's <m>c</m>ar.

          <p> There are two "totals" in this situation: the total weight (in pounds) of candy Ammie bought and the total amount of money (in dollars) Ammie spent. Let's begin with the total weight. If we let <m>N</m> represent the pounds of Nerds Gummy Clusters and <m>S</m> represent the pounds of Starburst Jelly Beans, which of the following equations can represent the total weight?
