Just like with quadratic functions, we can find the zeros of a function by setting the function equal to and solving for .      The end behavior  polynomial function end behavior of a polynomial function describes the behavior of the graph at the \"ends\" of the function. In other words, as we move to the right of the graph (as the values increase), what happens to the values? Similarly, as we move to the left of the graph (as the values decrease), what happens to the values?     Use the graphs of the following polynomial functions to answer the questions below.                    How would you describe the behavior of Graph A as you approach the ends?  Graph A rises on the left and on the right.  Graph A rises on the left, but falls on the right.  Graph A rises on the right, but falls on the left.  Graph A falls on the left and on the right.  How would you describe the behavior of Graph B as you approach the ends?  Graph B rises on the left and on the right.  Graph B rises on the left, but falls on the right.  Graph B rises on the right, but falls on the left.  Graph B falls on the left and on the right.  How would you describe the behavior of Graph C as you approach the ends?  Graph C rises on the left and on the right.  Graph C rises on the left, but falls on the right.  Graph C rises on the right, but falls on the left.  Graph C falls on the left and on the right.  How would you describe the behavior of Graph D as you approach the ends?  Graph D rises on the left and on the right.  Graph D rises on the left, but falls on the right.  Graph D rises on the right, but falls on the left.  Graph D falls on the left and on the right.     Typically, when given an equation of a polynomial function, we look at the degree and leading coefficient to help us determine the behavior of the ends. The degree is the highest exponential power in the polynomial. The leading coefficient is the number written in front of the variable with the highest exponential power.     Let's refer back to the graphs in and look at the equations of those polynomial functions. Let's apply to see if we can determine how the degree and leading coefficients of those graphs affect their end behavior.

What conjectures can you make about the relationship between their degrees and leading coefficients with the behavior of their graphs?  Notice that Graph B and Graph C have their ends going in opposite directions. What conjectures can you make about the relationship between their degrees and leading coefficients with the behavior of their graphs?     From , we saw that the degree and leading coefficient of a polynomial function can give us more clues about the behavior of the function. In summary, we know: If the degree is even, the ends of the polynomial function will be going in the same direction. If the leading coefficient is positive, both ends will be pointing up. If the leading coefficient is negative, both ends will be pointing down.  If the degree is odd, the ends of the polynomial function will be going in opposite directions. If the leading coefficient is positive, the left end will fall and the right end will rise. If the leading coefficient is negative, the left end will rise and the right end will fall.       When describing end behavior, mathematicians typically use arrow notation . Just as the name suggests, arrows are used to indicate the behavior of certain values on a graph.  For end behavior, students are often asked to determine the behavior of -values as -values either increase or decrease. The statement \"As , \" can be translated to \"As approaches infinity (or as increases), (or the -values) go to negative infinity (i.e., it decreases).\"      Use the graph of to answer the questions below.    A polynomial function with one even and one odd multiplicity      How would you describe the end behavior of ?   rises on the left and on the right.   rises on the left, but falls on the right.   rises on the right, but falls on the left.   falls on the left and on the right.

Using what you know about the zeros, multiplicities, and end behavior, where on the graph can we estimate the local maxima and minima to be?    Now look at the graph of . At which zero does a local maximum or local minimum occur? Explain how you know.      We can estimate where these local maxima and minima occur by looking at other characteristics, such as multiplicities and end behavior.  From , we saw that when the function touches the -axis at a zero, then that zero could be either a local maximum or a local minimum of the graph. When the function crosses the -axis, however, the local maximum or local minimum occurs between the zeros.      Exercises available at .
