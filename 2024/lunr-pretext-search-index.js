  "title": "Applications of Linear Equations (EQ2)",
  "body": " Applications of Linear Equations (EQ2)     Solve application problems involving linear equations.      Activities    Linear equations can be used to solve many types of real-world applications. We'll investigate some of those in this section.     Distance, rate, and time problems are a standard example of an application of a linear equation. For these, it's important to remember that where is distance, is the rate (or speed), and is time.  Often we will have more than one moving object, so it is helpful to denote which object's distance, rate, or time we are referring to. One way we can do this is by using a subscript. For example, if we are describing an eastbound train (as we will in the first example), it may be helpful to denote its distance, rate, and time as , , and respectively. Notice that the subscript is a label reminding us that we are referring to the eastbound train.     Two trains leave a station at the same time. One is heading east at a speed of 75 mph, while the other is heading west at a speed of 85 mph. After how long will the trains be 400 miles apart?    How fast is each train traveling?  mph, mph  mph, mph  mph, mph  mph, mph  mph, mph      Which of the statements describes how the times of the eastbound and westbound train are related?  The eastbound train is slower than the westbound train, so .  The eastbound train left an hour before the westbound train, so if we let , then .  Both trains have been traveling the same amount of time, so . Since they are the same, we can just call them both .  We don't know how the times relate to each other, so we must denote them separately as and .  Since the trains are traveling at different speeds, we need the proportion .      Fill in the following table using the information you've just determined about the trains' rates and times since they left the station. Some values are there to help you get started.      rate  time  distance from station    eastbound train        westbound train             At the moment in question, the trains are 400 miles apart. How does that total distance relate to the distance each train has traveled?  The 400 miles is irrelevant. They've been traveling the same amount of time so they must be the same distance away from the station. That tells us .  The 400 miles is the difference between the distance each train traveled, so .  The 400 miles represents the sum of the distances that each train has traveled, so .  The 400 miles is the product of the distance each train traveled, so .      Now plug in the expressions from your table for and . What equation do you get?                  Notice that we now have a linear equation in one variable, . Solve for , and put that answer in context of the problem.  The trains are 400 miles apart after 2 hours.  The trains are 400 miles apart after 2.5 hours.  The trains are 400 miles apart after 3 hours.  The trains are 400 miles apart after 3.5 hours.  The trains are 400 miles apart after 4 hours.      In we examined the motion of two objects moving at the same time in opposite directions. In we will examine a different perspective, but still apply to solve.    Jalen needs groceries, so decides to ride his bike to the store. It takes him half an hour to get there. After finishing his shopping, he sees his friend Alex who offers him a ride home. He takes the same route home as he did to the store, but this time it only takes one-fifth of an hour. If his average speed was mph faster on the way home, how far away does Jalen live from the grocery store?  We'll use the subscript to refer to variables relating to Jalen's trip to the store while riding his ike and the subscript to refer to variables relating to Jalen's trip home while riding in his friend's ar.    How long does his bike trip from home to the store and his car trip from the store back home take?  hours, hours  of an hour, of an hour  of an hour, of an hour  hours, hours  hours, hours      Which of the statements describes how the speed (rate) of the bike trip and the car trip are related?  Both the trip to the store and the trip home covered the same distance, so . Since they are the same, we can just call them both .  We don't know how the two rates relate to each other, so cannot write an equation comparing them and must leave them as separate variables and .  Jalen's rate on the trip home in the car was mph faster than his trip to the store on his bike, so if we let , then .  Jalen's rate on the trip home in the car was mph faster than his trip to the store on his bike, so if we let , then .      Fill in the following table using the information you've just determined about the Jalen's rates and times on each leg of his grocery store trip. Then fill in the distance column based on how distance relates to rate and time in each case.      rate  time  distance covered    bike trip (to the store)    car trip (going back home)        Our goal is to figure out how far away Jalen lives from the store. To help us get there, write an equation relating and .  The distance he traveled by bike is the same as the distance he traveled by car, so  The distance he traveled by bike took longer than the distance he traveled by car, so  The distance, , between his house and the grocery store is sum of the distance he traveled on his bike and the distance he traveled in the car, so .  The distance, , between his house and the grocery store is sum of the difference he traveled on his bike and the distance he traveled in the car, so .      Now plug in the expressions from your table for and into the equation you just found. Notice that it is a linear equation in one variable, . Solve for .    Our goal was to determine the distance between Jalen's house and the grocery store. Solving for did not tell us that distance, but it did get us one step closer. Use that value to help you determine the distance between his house and the store, and write your answer using the context of the problem. (Hint: can you find an expression involving that we made that represents that distance? )  The grocery store is 6 miles away from Jalen's house.  The grocery store is 8 miles away from Jalen's house.  The grocery store is 10 miles away from Jalen's house.  The grocery store is 12 miles away from Jalen's house.  The grocery store is 14 miles away from Jalen's house.      Another type of application of linear equations is called a mixture problem. In these we will mix together two things, like two types of candy in a candy store or two solutions of different concentrations of alcohol.    Ammie's favorite snack to share with friends is candy salad, which is a mixture of different types of candy. Today she chooses to mix Nerds Gummy Clusters, which cost $8.38 per pound, and Starburst Jelly Beans, which cost $7.16 per pound. If she makes seven pounds of candy salad and spends a total of $55.61, how many pounds of each candy did she buy?  We'll use the subscript to refer to variables relating to the Nerds and the subscript to refer to variables relating to the Starburt jelly beans.    question           A chemist needs to mix two solutions to create a mixture consisting of 30% alcohol. She uses 20 liters of the first solution, which has a concentration of 21% alcohol. How many liters of the second solution (that is 45% alcohol) should she add to the first solution tp create the mixture that is 30% alcohol?      Videos  Coming eventually.....   "

Activities    A quadratic equation is of the form: where and are coefficients (and  ), is the variable, and is the constant term.      Before beginning to solve quadratic equations, we need to be able to identify all various forms of quadratics.   Which of the following is a quadratic equation?                    To solve a quadratic equation, we will need to apply the zero product property , which states that if , then either or . In other words, you can only have a product of if one (or both!) of the factors is .      In this activity, we will look at how to apply the zero product property when solving quadratic equations.    Which of the following equations can you apply as your first step in solving?             Suppose you are given the quadratic equation, . Applying , would give you:      and    and    After applying the zero product property, what are the solutions to the quadratic equation ?   and    and    and   and     Notice in and , that not all equations are set up \"nicely.\" You will need to do some manipulation to get everything on one side (AND in factored form!) and on the other *before* applying the zero product property.     Suppose you want to solve the equation , which is NOT in factored form.    Which of the following is the correct factored form of ?             After applying , which of the following will be a solution to ?   and    and    and   and      Solve each of the following quadratic equations:          Suppose you are given the equation, :    How many solutions does this equation have?                 What are the solutions to this equation?                 How is this quadratic equation different than the equations we've solved thus far?      The square root property states that a quadratic equation of the form (where is a nonzero number) will give solutions and . In other words, if we have an equation with a perfect square on one side and a number on the other side, we can take the square root of both sides to solve the equation.       Suppose you are given the equation, :    What would be the first step in solving ?  Divide by on both sides  Subtract on both sides  Add on both sides  Multiply by on both sides     Isolate the term and apply solve for .    What are the solution(s) to ?           Solve the following quadratic equations by applying the square root property ( ).         Not all quadratic equations can be factored or can be solved by using the square root property. In the next few activities, we will learn two additional methods in solving quadratics.    Another method for solving a quadratic equation is known as completing the square . With this method, we add or subtract terms to both sides of an equation until we have a perfect square trinomial on one side of the equal sign and a constant on the other side. We then apply the square root property. Note: A perfect square trinomial is a trinomial that can be factored into a binomial squared. For example, is a perfect square trinomial because it can be factored into or .       Let's work through an example together to solve . (Notice that the methods of factoring and the square root property do not work with this equation.)    In order to apply , we first need to have a perfect square trinomial on one side of the equals sign. Which of the following number(s) could we add to the left side of the equation to create a perfect square trinomial?         Add your answer from part to the right side of the equation as well (i.e. whatever you do to one side of an equation you must do to the other side too!) and then factor the perfect square trinomial on the left side. Which equation best represents the equation now?         Apply the square root property ( ) to both sides of the equation to determine the solution(s). Which of the following is the solution(s) of ?  and  and  and  and      To complete the square, the leading coefficient, (i.e., the coefficient of the term), must equal . If it does not, then factor the entire equation by and then follow similar steps as in .     Let's solve the equation by completing the square.    Rewrite the equation so that all the terms with the variable is on one side of the equation and a constant is on the other.    Notice that the coefficient of the term is not . What could we factor the left side of the equation by so that the coefficient of the is ?    Once you factor the left side, what equation represents the equation you now have?         Just like in , let's now try and create the perfect square trinomial (inside the parentheses) on the left side of the equation. Which of the following number(s) could we add to the left side of the equation to create a perfect square trinomial?         What would we need to add to the right-hand side of the equation to keep the equation balanced?         Which of the following equation represents the quadratic equation you have now?         Apply the square root property and solve the quadratic equation.      Solve the following quadratic equations by completing the square.       The last method for solving quadratic equations is the quadratic formula - a formula that will solve all quadratic equations! A quadratic equation of the form can be solved by the quadratic formula: where , , and are real numbers and .     Use the quadratic formula ( ) to solve .

Activities    Just like with quadratic functions, we should be able to determine key characteristics that will help guide us in creating a sketch of any polynomial function. We can start by finding both and -intercepts and then explore other characteristics polynomial functions can have. Recall that the zeros of a function are the -intercepts - i.e., the values of that cross or touch the -axis. Just like with quadratic functions, we can find the zeros of a function by setting the function equal to and solving for .      The end behavior  polynomial function end behavior of a polynomial function describes the behavior of the graph at the \"ends\" of the function. In other words, as we move to the right of the graph (as the values increase), what happens to the values? Similarly, as we move to the left of the graph (as the values decrease), what happens to the values?     Use the graphs of the following polynomial functions to answer the questions below.                    How would you describe the behavior of Graph A as you approach the ends?

From , we saw that the degree and leading coefficient of a polynomial function can give us more clues about the behavior of the function. In summary, we know: If the degree is even, the ends of the polynomial function will be going in the same direction. If the leading coefficient is positive, both ends will be pointing up. If the leading coefficient is negative, both ends will be pointing down.  If the degree is odd, the ends of the polynomial function will be going in opposite directions. If the leading coefficient is positive, the left end will fall and the right end will rise. If the leading coefficient is negative, the left end will rise and the right end will fall.       When describing end behavior, mathematicians typically use arrow notation . Just as the name suggests, arrows are used to indicate the behavior of certain values on a graph.  For end behavior, students are often asked to determine the behavior of -values as -values either increase or decrease. The statement \"As , \" can be translated to \"As approaches infinity (or as increases), (or the -values) go to negative infinity (i.e., it decreases).\"      Use the graph of to answer the questions below.    A polynomial function with one even and one odd multiplicity      How would you describe the end behavior of ?   rises on the left and on the right.   rises on the left, but falls on the right.   rises on the right, but falls on the left.   falls on the left and on the right.

Using what you know about the zeros, multiplicities, and end behavior, where on the graph can we estimate the local maxima and minima to be?    Now look at the graph of . At which zero does a local maximum or local minimum occur? Explain how you know.      We can estimate where these local maxima and minima occur by looking at other characteristics, such as multiplicities and end behavior.  From , we saw that when the function touches the -axis at a zero, then that zero could be either a local maximum or a local minimum of the graph. When the function crosses the -axis, however, the local maximum or local minimum occurs between the zeros.      Exercises available at .

In order to understand the end behavior of , we will start by writing the function in a different algebraic form. Multiply the numerator and denominator of by . Then distribute and simplify as much as possible in both the numerator and denominator to write in a different algebraic form. Which of the following is that new form?            another wrong answer?     Now determine the end behavior of each piece of the numerator and each piece of the denominator. Hint: Use to help!  Simplify your work from the previous step. Which of the following best describes the end behavior of ?  As , goes to .  As , goes to .  As , goes to .  As , goes to .    "
