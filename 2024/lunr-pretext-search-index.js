The multiplicity  polynomial function multiplicity of a polynomial function is the number of times a given factor appears in the factored form of the equation of a polynomial.  The zero, in has multiplicity because the factor occurs twice (the exponent is a ).      Use the function, to answer the following questions:   What are the zeros of ?              Using , determine the multiplicities of the zeros you found in part .   Now graph and look at the zeros on the graph. What do you notice about the behavior of the graph at each zero?      Refer back to and . Notice that when the graph crosses the -axis at the zero, the mulitplicity of that zero is odd. When the graph touches the -axis at the zero, the multiplicity is even. In other words, factors of with odd exponents will cross the -axis and factors of with even exponents will touch the -axis.      The end behavior  polynomial function end behavior of a polynomial function describes the behavior of the graph at the \"ends\" of the function. In other words, as we move to the right of the graph (as the values increase), what happens to the values? Similarly, as we move to the left of the graph (as the values decrease), what happens to the values?     Use the graphs of the following polynomial functions to answer the questions below.                    How would you describe the behavior of Graph A as you approach the ends?  Graph A rises on the left and on the right.  Graph A rises on the left, but falls on the right.  Graph A rises on the right, but falls on the left.  Graph A falls on the left and on the right.  How would you describe the behavior of Graph B as you approach the ends?  Graph B rises on the left and on the right.  Graph B rises on the left, but falls on the right.  Graph B rises on the right, but falls on the left.  Graph B falls on the left and on the right.  How would you describe the behavior of Graph C as you approach the ends?  Graph C rises on the left and on the right.  Graph C rises on the left, but falls on the right.  Graph C rises on the right, but falls on the left.  Graph C falls on the left and on the right.  How would you describe the behavior of Graph D as you approach the ends?  Graph D rises on the left and on the right.  Graph D rises on the left, but falls on the right.  Graph D rises on the right, but falls on the left.  Graph D falls on the left and on the right.     Typically, when given an equation of a polynomial function, we look at the degree and leading coefficient to help us determine the behavior of the ends. The degree is the highest exponential power in the polynomial. The leading coefficient is the number written in front of the variable with the highest exponential power.     Let's refer back to the graphs in and look at the equations of those polynomial functions. Let's apply to see if we can determine how the degree and leading coefficients of those graphs affect their end behavior. Graph A:   Graph B:  Graph C:  Graph D:                      What is the degree and leading coefficient of Graph A?  Degree: ; Leading Coefficient:   Degree: ; Leading Coefficient:   Degree: ; Leading Coefficient:   Degree: ; Leading Coefficient:   What is the degree and leading coefficient of Graph B?

Degree: ; Leading Coefficient:   Degree: ; Leading Coefficient:   Degree: ; Leading Coefficient:   Degree: ; Leading Coefficient:   Notice that Graph A and Graph D have their ends going in the same direction. What conjectures can you make about the relationship between their degrees and leading coefficients with the behavior of their graphs?  Notice that Graph B and Graph C have their ends going in opposite directions. What conjectures can you make about the relationship between their degrees and leading coefficients with the behavior of their graphs?     From , we saw that the degree and leading coefficient of a polynomial function can give us more clues about the behavior of the function. In summary, we know: If the degree is even, the ends of the polynomial function will be going in the same direction. If the leading coefficient is positive, both ends will be pointing up. If the leading coefficient is negative, both ends will be pointing down.  If the degree is odd, the ends of the polynomial function will be going in opposite directions. If the leading coefficient is positive, the left end will fall and the right end will rise. If the leading coefficient is negative, the left end will rise and the right end will fall.       When describing end behavior, mathematicians typically use arrow notation . Just as the name suggests, arrows are used to indicate the behavior of certain values on a graph.  For end behavior, students are often asked to determine the behavior of -values as -values either increase or decrease. The statement \"As , \" can be translated to \"As approaches infinity (or as increases), (or the -values) go to negative infinity (i.e., it decreases).\"      Use the graph of to answer the questions below.    A polynomial function with one even and one odd multiplicity      How would you describe the end behavior of ?   rises on the left and on the right.   rises on the left, but falls on the right.   rises on the right, but falls on the left.   falls on the left and on the right.   How would you describe the end behavior of using arrow notation?   As ,   As ,     As ,   As ,     As ,   As ,     As ,   As ,         When graphing polynomial functions, you may notice that these functions have some \"hills\" and \"valleys.\" These characteristics of the graph are known as the local maxima and local minima of the graph. The maximum value of a graph is the point where the -coordinate has the largest value. The minimum value is the point on the graph where the -coordinate has the smallest value. The local maxima is the highest -value in that region of the graph. The local minima is the lowest -value in that region of the graph.A graph, therefore, can have many local maxima\/minima.  We can estimate where these local maxima and minima occur by looking at other characteristics, such as multiplicities and end behavior.      Use the given function, , to answer the following questions.    What are the zeros of ?                What are the multiplicities at each zero?   At , the mulitplicity is even.  At , the mulitplicity is even.    At , the mulitplicity is even.  At , the mulitplicity is odd.   At , the mulitplicity is odd.  At , the mulitplicity is even.    At , the mulitplicity is odd.

What is the end behavior of ?   rises on the left and on the right.   rises on the left, but falls on the right.   rises on the right, but falls on the left.   falls on the left and on the right.    Using what you know about the zeros, multiplicities, and end behavior, where on the graph can we estimate the local maxima and minima to be?    Now look at the graph of . At which zero does a local maximum or local minimum occur? Explain how you know.      From , we saw that when the function touches the -axis at a zero, then that zero could be either a local maximum or a local minimum of the graph. When the function crosses the -axis, however, the local maximum or local minimum occurs between the zeros.      Sketch the function, , by first finding the given characteristics.    Find the zeros of .  Find the multiplicities at each zero.  Find the -intercept of .  Describe the end behavior of .  Estimate where any local maximums and minimums may occur.    ***DOES THIS GO HERE???**** A polynomial function is a function that can be expressed in the form of a polynomial. Just like other functions, polynomial functions have many different features. Before we can begin to look at how polynomial functions can be used, we must first be able to identify what makes a polynomial function and what typical characteristics they have.    Some of the graphs shown below are polynomial functions and some are not. Use the following graphs to explore the charactertistics of polynomials.                             By looking at the graphs that are labeled \"NOT a Polynomial Function,\" what type of characteristics do you notice? How are these different from the graphs labeled as being polynomial functions?  Can you make any conjectures about what characteristics all polynomials have based on what you see on these graphs?      There are two primary characteristics we typically use to distinguish polynomial functions from other functions. Polynomial functions have graphs that are smooth and continuous. Smooth functions are functions that contain only rounded curves (no sharp corners). Continuous functions are functions that can be drawn without lifting your pencil (no breaks).  Notice that although exponential functions, as one example, appear to be smooth and continuous, these are NOT considered polynomial functions because they have asymptotes that affect the behavior of their graphs. Can you think of other functions which might have similar properties but are not considered polynomial functions?      Now that we know what polynomial functions look like, we should be able to determine some characteristics. Use the graph below to find the given charactertistics.    Polynomial Function      What are the -intercept(s) of the polynomial function? Select all that apply.              What are the -intercept(s) of the polynomial function?             How many zeros does this polynomial function have?               At what point is the local minimum located?                  At what point is the local maximum located?                  How do you describe the behavior of the polynomial function as ?  the -values go to negative infinity     the -values go to positive infinity      How do you describe the behavior of the polynomial function as ?  the -values go to negative infinity     the -values go to positive infinity         Sketch the graph of a function that meets all of the following criteria. Be sure to scale your axes and label any important features of your graph.   The -intercepts of are and .  has one maximum at 0. has one minimum at and another at .

Can you see anything in the factored form of that may help you account for the difference?     When we are finding the domain of a rational function rational function domain , , we look for all values that would make the denominator equal zero. Then the domain is the set of all real numbers except those for which         Features of a rational function  Let be a rational function.     If and , then , so has a zero rational function zero at .    If and , then is undefined and has a vertical asymptote rational function vertical asymptote at .    If and and we can show that there is a finite number such that , then is not defined and has a hole rational function hole at the point .        Another property of rational functions we want to explore is the end behavior. This means we want to explore what happens to a given rational function when goes toward positive infinity or negative infinity.   Consider the rational function . Plug in some very large positive numbers for to see what is tending toward. Which of the following best describes the behavior of the graph as approaches positive infinity?  As , .  As , .  As , .  As , .    Now let's look at as tends toward negative infinity. Plug in some very large negative numbers for to see what is tending toward. Which of the following best describes the behavior of the graph as approaches negative infinity?  As , .  As , .  As , .  As , .       We can generalize what we have just found to any function of the form , where . Since increases without bound as , we find that will tend to 0. In fact, the numerator can be any constant and the function will still tend to 0!  Similarly, as , we find that will tend to 0 too.      Consider the rational function .  Observe that the largest power of that's present in is . In addition, because of the dominant terms of in the numerator and in the denominator, both the numerator and denominator of increase without bound as increases without bound.   In order to understand the end behavior of , we will start by writing the function in a different algebraic form. Multiply the numerator and denominator of by . Then distribute and simplify as much as possible in both the numerator and denominator to write in a different algebraic form. Which of the following is that new form?            another wrong answer?     Now determine the end behavior of each piece of the numerator and each piece of the denominator. Hint: Use to help!  Simplify your work from the previous step. Which of the following best describes the end behavior of ?  As , goes to .  As , goes to .  As , goes to .  As , goes to .       If the end behavior of a function tends toward a specific value , then we say that the function has a horizontal asymptote at .      Find the horizontal asymptote (if one exists) of the following rational functions. Follow the same method we used in .                  There is no horizontal asymptote.                   There is no horizontal asymptote.                  There is no horizontal asymptote.       Some patterns have emerged from the previous problem.
