<div class="para">Our goal was to determine the distance between Jalen’s house and the grocery store. Solving for <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> did not tell us that distance, but it did get us one step closer. Use that value to help you determine the distance between his house and the store, and write your answer using the context of the problem. (Hint: can you find an expression involving <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> that we made that represents that distance? )</div>
