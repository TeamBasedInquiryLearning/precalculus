</div> <div class="para">Often we will have more than one moving object, so it is helpful to denote which object’s distance, rate, or time we are referring to. One way we can do this is by using a subscript. For example, if we are describing an eastbound train (as we will in the first example), it may be helpful to denote its distance, rate, and time as <span class="process-math">\(d_E\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(r_E\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(t_E\)</span> respectively. Notice that the subscript <span class="process-math">\(E\)</span> is a label reminding us that we are referring to the eastbound train.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="EQ2.html#remark-1">in-context</a></span>
