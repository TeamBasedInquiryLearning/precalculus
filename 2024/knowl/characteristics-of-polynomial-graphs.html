<div class="para">There are two primary characteristics we typically use to distinguish polynomial functions from other functions. Polynomial functions have graphs that are smooth and continuous. <dfn class="terminology">Smooth functions</dfn> are functions that contain only rounded curves (no sharp corners). <dfn class="terminology">Continuous functions</dfn> are functions that can be drawn without lifting your pencil (no breaks).</div> <div class="para">Notice that although exponential functions, as one example, appear to be smooth and continuous, these are NOT considered polynomial functions because they have asymptotes that affect the behavior of their graphs. Can you think of other functions which might have similar properties but are not considered polynomial functions?</div></article><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="PR5.html#characteristics-of-polynomial-graphs">in-context</a></span>
