<div class="para">Jalen needs groceries, so rides his bike to the store and it takes him half an hour. After finishing his shopping, he sees his friend Alex who offers him a ride home. He takes the same route home as he did to the store, but this time it only takes one-fifth of an hour. If his average rate was <span class="process-math">\(18\)</span> mph faster on the way home, how far away does Jalen live from the grocery store?</div>
